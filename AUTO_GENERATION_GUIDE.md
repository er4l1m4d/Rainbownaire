# 🤖 Automatic Question Generation System

## 🎉 Overview

Your Rainbownaire quiz now has **intelligent automatic question generation**! Questions are generated on-demand when users start quizzes, saved to the database for reuse, and users never see the same question twice.

---

## ✨ How It Works

### **Smart 3-Step Process:**

```
User Starts Quiz
    ↓
1️⃣ Check Database (Instant - 0.1s)
   ✅ Found 10/15 questions
    ↓
2️⃣ Auto-Generate Missing (Fast - 2s with Gemini)
   🤖 Generate 5 new questions
   💾 Save to database
    ↓
3️⃣ Return 15 Unique Questions
   🎮 Quiz starts!
```

### **Key Features:**

- ✅ **Database First** - Uses existing questions (instant)
- ✅ **Auto-Generate** - Creates new ones when needed (Gemini 1-2s each)
- ✅ **Save for Reuse** - All generated questions stored in database
- ✅ **No Repeats** - Tracks which questions each user has seen
- ✅ **Growing Catalog** - Database grows automatically over time
- ✅ **Fallback System** - Uses sample questions if everything fails

## 🎯 Question Pool Strategy

### **Database Growth:**

| Users | Questions in DB | Generate? | Speed |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | 0 | Yes (15) | 3s |
| 1 | 15 | Maybe (0-15) | 0.1-3s |
| 5 | 50-75 | Rarely | 0.1s |
| 10 | 100+ | Almost never | 0.1s |
| 50+ | 500+ | Only if user saw many | 0.1s |

### **Smart Selection:**

1. **Prioritize unseen questions** for each user
2. **Mix difficulties** (40% easy, 40% medium, 20% hard)
3. **Variety of categories** (Rainbow, Web3, DeFi, NFTs, Security)
4. **Random order** every time

---

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### **Get Questions for Quiz**

```bash
GET /api/questions?count=15&difficulty=mixed&category=mixed&walletAddress=0x...

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "questions": [...15 questions...],
  "count": 15,
  "source": "mixed" // database + auto-generated
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `count` (optional): Number of questions (default: 15)
- `difficulty` (optional): easy | medium | hard | mixed (default: mixed)
- `category` (optional): rainbow_wallet | web3_basics | defi | nfts | security | mixed
- `walletAddress` (optional): User's wallet to avoid repeats

### **Pre-Warm Question Pool**

```bash
POST /api/questions
{
  "action": "prewarm",
  "targetCount": 100
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "generated": 100,
  "total": 100,
  "message": "Question pool pre-warmed"
}
```

## 📝 Implementation Details

### **Question Pool Manager**

Located in: `lib/ai/question-pool-manager.ts`

**Main Method:**
```typescript
await questionPoolManager.getQuestionsForQuiz({
  count: 15,
  difficulty: 'mixed',
  category: 'mixed',
  playerWalletAddress: '0x...'
});
```

**What It Does:**
1. Gets player's question history
2. Queries database for approved questions (excluding seen ones)
3. If not enough, auto-generates with Gemini
4. Saves generated questions to database
5. Returns exactly 15 unique questions

---

## 💾 Database Schema

### **questions table:**
```sql
- id: string (unique)
- question_text: string
- options: string[]
- correct_answer: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D'
- difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
- category: string
- is_ai_generated: boolean
- approved: boolean (auto-approved for seamless UX)
- created_at: timestamp
```

### **quiz_session_questions table:**
```sql
- id: string
- session_id: string (FK to quiz_sessions)
- question_id: string (FK to questions)
- selected_answer: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D'
- is_correct: boolean
- answered_at: timestamp
```

**Purpose:** Track which questions each player has seen

---

## 🎨 Integration with Quiz

### **Current Flow:**

**Before (Static Questions):**
```typescript
// quiz/page.tsx
const questions = sampleQuestions; // Fixed 15 questions
```

**After (Dynamic Questions):**
```typescript
// quiz/page.tsx (to be updated)
const response = await fetch('/api/questions?walletAddress=0x...');
const { questions } = await response.json();
```

## ⚡ Performance

### **Speed Metrics:**

| Scenario | Time | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| All from DB | 0.1s | Instant ⚡ |
| 5 from DB + 10 generated | 2.5s | Gemini generates |
| All generated (15) | 3-5s | First user only |
| Fallback (no API key) | 0.01s | Sample questions |

### **Optimization:**

- ✅ Parallel generation (generates multiple at once)
- ✅ Database indexing (fast queries)
- ✅ Caching (reuse questions)
- ✅ Smart selection (avoids repeats efficiently)

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Question Pool Size:**

Default: Auto-grows with usage

Optional: Pre-warm with 100 questions
```bash
POST /api/questions
{
  "action": "prewarm",
  "targetCount": 100
}
```

### **Auto-Approval:**

Currently: All AI-generated questions are auto-approved

To require manual approval:
```typescript
// question-pool-manager.ts
approved: false, // Change from true to false
```

Then use admin UI to approve questions.

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **1. Pre-Warm on Launch (Optional)**

Build initial catalog before users arrive:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/questions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "prewarm", "targetCount": 100}'
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant quiz starts for all users
- No waiting on first use
- Better first impression

### **2. Monitor Pool Size**

Check your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions WHERE approved = true;
```

### **3. Quality Control**

Periodically review AI-generated questions:
```sql
SELECT * FROM questions 
WHERE is_ai_generated = true 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"No questions returned"**

**Possible causes:**
1. Database not created yet → Uses fallback questions (sample)
2. Gemini API key missing → Uses fallback questions
3. Network error → Uses fallback questions

**Solution:** Check console logs for specific error

### **"Same questions appear"**

**Possible causes:**
1. Small question pool (< 30 questions)
2. Player history not tracked (wallet not connected)

**Solution:**
- Pre-warm pool with more questions
- Ensure wallet connection is working

### **"Slow quiz start"**

**Possible causes:**
1. Generating questions (first users)
2. Database query slow

**Solution:**
- Pre-warm the pool
- Check database indexes

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### **Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **Question Pool Size**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions;
   ```

2. **AI-Generated vs Manual**
   ```sql
   SELECT is_ai_generated, COUNT(*) 
   FROM questions 
   GROUP BY is_ai_generated;
   ```

3. **Most Used Questions**
   ```sql
   SELECT question_id, COUNT(*) as uses
   FROM quiz_session_questions
   GROUP BY question_id
   ORDER BY uses DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Average Quiz Start Time**
   - Track in application logs

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Pre-Warm for Production**

Before launch, generate 200 questions:
```bash
# Takes ~5 minutes, but users get instant experience
POST /api/questions {"action": "prewarm", "targetCount": 200}
```

### **Tip 2: Monitor Generation Costs**

Gemini is free (60 requests/minute), but monitor:
- How many questions generated per day
- Pool growth rate
- API usage

### **Tip 3: Quality Over Quantity**

Better to have 100 great questions than 1000 mediocre ones.
- Review generated questions periodically
- Mark bad ones as `approved: false`
- Regenerate categories that need improvement
