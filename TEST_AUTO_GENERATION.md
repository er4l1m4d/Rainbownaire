# 🧪 Testing Auto-Generation System

## Quick Test Guide

### ✅ Test 1: Check Build (DONE)
Fixed the webpack error - build now works! ✅

### ✅ Test 2: API Endpoint

**Test getting questions:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/questions?count=5
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "questions": [...5 questions...],
  "count": 5,
  "source": "mixed"
}
```

### ✅ Test 3: Pre-Warm Pool (Optional)

**Generate 10 questions for testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/questions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"action\": \"prewarm\", \"targetCount\": 10}"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "generated": 10,
  "total": 10,
  "message": "Question pool pre-warmed"
}
```

## 🎯 What to Expect

### First Time (No DB Questions):
1. API will try database → empty
2. Auto-generate with Gemini → takes 2-5 seconds
3. Save to database
4. Return questions

### Second Time (With DB Questions):
1. API finds questions in database → instant (0.1s)
2. Return questions
