## Key Decisions

### Dependency Installation Strategy
- Installing dependencies in batches of 3 (as requested)
- Order: Critical → UI → Web3 → Database → AI → Testing

### Database Schema
- Using Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- 5 core tables: players, questions, quiz_sessions, quiz_session_questions, leaderboard_entries
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for all tables

### AI Strategy
- Pre-generation + caching approach
- No live AI calls during gameplay
- Daily batch generation via cron jobs

## Environment Variables Needed
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=

---

## Performance Targets
- FCP (First Contentful Paint): ≤ 1.5s
- TTI (Time to Interactive): ≤ 2.5s
- API Latency (p95): ≤ 300ms
- Availability: > 99.9%

---

## Notes & Reminders
- Always prioritize Rainbow Wallet aesthetic (vibrant gradients, playful motion)
- Error messages must be friendly and themed (e.g., "Your wallet flew away 🪄")
- Accessibility is critical (WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation)
- Mobile-first design approach
